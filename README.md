# TransArch: Hardware-Aware Architecture Transfer for Foundation Models

Modern large language models are increasingly bottlenecked by communication rather than computation on today's hardware. **TransArch** is a collection of research projects that design hardware-friendly model architectures and migrate existing pre-trained models into these new architectures with minimal performance loss.

## 📦 Projects

| Project | Venue | Description | Paper |
|---------|-------|-------------|-------|
| **CLOVER** | ICML 2025 | Cross-layer SVD pruning of Q-K and V-O pairs in attention heads; combined with TransMLA achieves up to 11.1× speedup over LLaMA-2-7B | [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17426) |
| **TransMLA** | NeurIPS 2025 Spotlight | Convert GQA models (LLaMA, Qwen, Mixtral, …) to DeepSeek-MLA with full Absorb compatibility and up to 10.6× inference speedup | [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07864) |
| **TPLA** | ASPLOS 2026 | Tensor Parallel Latent Attention — partitions latent representations across devices, achieving 1.79×/1.93× speedup on DeepSeek-V3/Kimi-K2 | [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15881) |
| **HISA** | Preprint | Hierarchical two-stage indexer for fine-grained sparse attention, achieving 2×–4× speedup at 32K–128K context | [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.28458) |
| **MISA** | Preprint | Mixture-of-experts routing over DSA indexer heads — matches dense DSA with 8×/4× fewer indexer heads and ~3.82× kernel speedup on H200 | [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.07363) |
| **GQLA** | Preprint | Group-Query Latent Attention — one set of weights, two decoding paths (MQA-absorb for H100, GQA+MTP for H20), with up to 8-way TP | [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.15250) |
